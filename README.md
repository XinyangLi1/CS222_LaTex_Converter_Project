# CS222_LaTex_Converter_Project
Group 0 

Modern day college tech courses (CS, DS, MATH, STAT etc.) all either recommend or request LaTex typing homework and projects. While it could be challenging for inexperienced students and quite time consuming to type-set their works. While there are tools like ChatGpt to help them format their work into LaTex,  it lacks instant feedback and is limited by tokens. We want to create a tool to instantly generate LaTex code from handwritten inputs as well as uploaded photos that run on usersâ€™ end, which could facilitate the process of math works, and help students learn LaTex.
